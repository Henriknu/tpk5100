            <b>Mandate</b>
            <p>Document describing the scope of the project</p>

            <b>Rationale</b>
            <p>
              An explanation of the reason the project is required in the particular area.
              <br />
              <br />There are four categories of rationales:
              <ul>
                  <li>Solve an existing problem (usually a sense of urgency to maintain viable operation)</li>
                  <li> Prevent a future problem (incl. assessment, maintenance, updates)</li>
                  <li> Achieve a business goal or a strategic goal</li>
                  <li>Seize an opportunity in a new technology or new market</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <b>Purpose</b>
            <p>
              A value oriented formulation of what the project result is to be used for; main function.
            </p>
            <b>Trigger factor</b>
            <p>
             Description of the current situation that triggered project initiation
             <br> <br>
            Difference between the two: the time aspect. <br>
            <b>Purpose</b> := desired future state <br>
            <b>Trigger factor</b> := factual description of the starting point
            </p>
            <b>Outcome, objectives</b>
            <p>
              Intended benefits that could be realized if the project delivers a product that fulfills its purpose. Includes effects on business, organization, end users. There is high uncertainty related to fulfillment of the objectives.
            </p>
           <b> Deliverables, output, end goals</b>
           <p>Tangible descriptions of what the project should result in.</p>

            <p>
              The project manager and project owner work with these four phases, but have to look at the project from a holistic perspective to secure the desired effects of the project after delivery.

            </p>
             <p>
               The project output will produce several outcomes. The task is to maximize the positive effects and minimize the negative effects of the project. Thus, the project manager and project owner strive for the best ‚Äòtotal package‚Äô of outcomes, even though no one has complete control of the contextual uncertainty.

             </p>
              <p>
                There are many examples of projects delivered according to specifications and QCT frameworks, but still produce undesirable effects on the environment, organization and users. Reverse cases are also found, where the execution of the project did not meet expectations but still gave positive effects.
  Note: delivering a project according to its specifications does not necessarily secure fulfillment of the desired effects!
              </p>
              <p><b>How to realize the desired benefits?</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Good project management and good follow-up facilitates this</li>
                <li>There is an element of uncertainty in contexts that are beyond the control of individuals, and thus always constitutes a risk</li>
                <li>Acknowledge that there is a wide range of perspectives and interests to consider</li>
                <li>the perspectives ü°™ assessment criteria for success or failure, as perceived by the various groups
perspectives 	   + 	contextual uncertainty 	   = 	project characteristics (Ch. 3)</li>

              </ul>
