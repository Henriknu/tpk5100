        <v-expansion-panel-content>
          <div>
            <p>The project lifecycle is a visualization of the most important tasks and processes required to reach the project’s goal. The lifecycle divides the project into four phases (Initiation, Planning, Execution & Control and Close out), separated by decision gates.</p>

          <h5>The purpose of defining a project lifecycle</h5>
        </v-expansion-panel-header>
        <v-expansion-panel-content>
          <div>
            <p>There are two main purposes of defining the project lifecycle, depending on your perspective:</p>
            <p>
              For the
              <em>project manager</em> this purpose is to be able to plan and manage. From this perspective, there are several reasons to define the lifecycle:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>To get an overview</li>
              <li>Describe the required tasks for the project's execution</li>
              <li>Understand the need for resources in the various phases</li>
              <li>Consider when the various stakeholders should be involved</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              For the
              <em>project owner</em> the purpose of defining a lifecycle is to gain control. From this perspective, the point is to fix the decision gates. The following activities are done at the decision gate:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Assess status</li>
              <li>Ensure follow-up</li>
              <li>Reassess goals</li>
              <li>Adjust ambitions</li>
              <li>Potentially terminate the project, postpone the project or allow progression to the next stage.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </v-expansion-panel-content>
      </v-expansion-panel>
      <v-expansion-panel>
        <v-expansion-panel-header>
          <h5>The lifecycle</h5>
        </v-expansion-panel-header>
        <v-expansion-panel-content>
          <div>
            <img
              class="chapter-img"
              src="../../../public/img/chapter-images/image1.png"
              alt="Lifecycle"
            />
            <p>The project manager and project owner work with these four phases but have to look at the project from a holistic perspective to secure the desired effects of the project after delivery.</p>
            <p>The project output will produce several outcomes. The task is to maximize the positive effects and minimize the negative effects of the project. Thus, the project manager and project owner strive for the best ‘total package’ of outcomes, even though no one has complete control of the contextual uncertainty.</p>
            <p>There are many examples of projects delivered according to specifications and QCT frameworks, but still produce undesirable effects on the environment, organization and users. Reverse cases are also found, where the execution of the project did not meet expectations but still gave positive effects.</p>
            <p>
              <em>Note: delivering a project according to its specifications does not necessarily secure fulfillment of the desired effects!</em>

        <v-expansion-panel-content>
          <div>
            <p>There are multiple aspects which could contribute to the achievement of the project's desired benefits:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Good project management and good follow-up routines.</li>
              <li>There is an element of uncertainty in contexts that are beyond the control of individuals, and thus always constitutes a risk.</li>
              <li>Acknowledge that there is a wide range of perspectives and interests to consider.</li>
              <li>
                The different perspectives provide assessment criteria for success or failure, as perceived by the various groups
                perspectives + contextual uncertainty = project characteristics (Ch. 3)
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Each stakeholder category corresponds to one perspective.
              Project management as a field of study is about structuring and organizing the way projects are carried out in order to attend to all these perspectives. It is key to acknowledge that the project lives on (through the effects) after close-out, and has consequences for the owner, the organization, the end user and the environment. Balancing the different perspectives requires collaboration, close communication, involvement and trust between the client, end—user and project organization.

          <h5>The Project owner perspective</h5>
        </v-expansion-panel-header>
        <v-expansion-panel-content>
          <div>
            <p>The project owner (Client/customer) initiates the project. They define the problem, purpose, guidelines and limitations, and intended business / organizational outcome (ex. better reputation, cost efficiency, freeing up resources). They have the biggest interest, eagerness and ‘self-inflicted’ involvement in the project in the initial phase and upon handover. They expect much but wants to use minimal resources.</p>
            <p>Success factors for the client are good processes for follow-up (decision gates) and involvement throughout the lifecycle.</p>

          <h5>The End-user perspective</h5>
        </v-expansion-panel-header>
        <v-expansion-panel-content>
          <div>
            <p>The end-users are groups or individuals whom are to live with the result of the project after implementation (use, operate, maintain, buy, transport, interact with the product). We distinguish between those who belong to the project organization (Internal) and clients of the owner (External).</p>
            <p>The end users have expectations and demands in order to use the product, such as characteristics, functional requirements, operational requirements. They also have expectations of outcomes; simplify or improve everyday life. It is necessary to accommodate to the key demands for the project to fulfill its purpose and be used!</p>
            <p>The end-users have the greatest interest in handover and operation phase but must be involved from the start in order to meet their expectations. Sources of conflict with this stakeholder group are that they have too extensive and high demands and expect all demands and wishes to be met.</p>
            <p>Success factors for the end-user are ownership and sufficient involvement in the decision-making processes that have a direct impact on the outcome. It is important that they understand the purpose as well as the limitations and guidelines that have been laid down.</p>

          <h5>Project organization perspective</h5>
        </v-expansion-panel-header>
        <v-expansion-panel-content>
          <div>
            <p>The project organization sees the project as a collection of unique processes with the intention of delivering a result within the given constraints. The processes must respond to the trigger and stakeholder requirements. The key is to unify the perspectives by structuring work processes as early as possible</p>
            <p>One vital success factor for the project organization is to facilitate processes that build trust, anchoring, ownership and involvement. It is important to focus on the success factors that are appropriate for the given project and balance the perspectives, in order to achieve the goals.</p>
